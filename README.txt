so this is a resourcepack for Into The Breach, not to be confused with the very popular game with a banger soundtrack, Into The Breach, now available for steam, android, ios, and netflix?.

anyways dont use stuff w/o permission, idk why you would want to tho cus all the gun models look like actual water guns, but feel free to use the python script for ur own resourcepacks.
as of writing this u have to add the folder paths that you want to be upshifted manually in the .py file itself but i might make it a json sometime later then forget to update this.
